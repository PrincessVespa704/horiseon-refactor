# <Horiseon-Webpage-Refactor>

## Description

The Horiseon website needed to be refactored in order to follow accessibility standards and was optimized for search engines. Considering the company is focused on SEO optimization for clients, and the site itself was missing SEO optimization elements for its own success, this project was a critical need.

By adding semantic elements, the website is now accessible and findable to a much wider audience. This website now meets the accessibility standards to reach all potential clients. 

This project taught me the importance of using semantic elements and to organize code in a way that enables successful collaboration by helping to find what elements of the website are coded in what section of the html and css files. My motivation for this project was to learn more about accessibility standards as well as to create "clean code" that is formatted properly.
